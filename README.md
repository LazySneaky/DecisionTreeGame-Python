# Branching Narrative (Python Text Adventure)

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20development-yellow)

> ðŸš§ Still in development â€” right now only the Cave path works. Forest path is coming soon!

A simple little text adventure game in Python where **you choose what happens next**.  
Pick a path, make your moves, and see where the story takes you.  
Every decision changes the outcome â€” so no two runs are the same.

## ðŸŽ® Whatâ€™s in the game?
- **Typewriter-style text** for that retro adventure vibe
